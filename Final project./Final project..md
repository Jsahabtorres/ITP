#Final project.
FOr this project I decided to do a website, since i'm graduating this semester and I thought it would be a good idea to have a place where people could find all my work such as resume, contact information, social media, etc.
Also, since wix is not very accessible for screen readers, the HTML file to create it seem to be the best optionn for me.
For this project I gave the initial instruction to chat GPT of guiding me step by step on how to create an html file to create a website, considering i'm using voiceover, the mac screen reader.
After everything was completed with what I needed, I also ascked it to guide me step by step on how to uploaded to github so its available on the internet.
Finally, I ascked it how to fix some little issues step by step so people could download my resume.
I think this project was very useful, since it allowed me to explore a new way of creating websites of an easier way and making it totally accessible.
IN this link you can find the whole conversation.
