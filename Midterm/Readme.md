#Midterm project.
For the first sound I was able to load the file and use the code to make it play, but for the second sound things where a little bit more hard, since find the correct place to tipe the other codes was not very easy since navagate inside the text field was a bit complicate, as well as the fact that the menu to upload a file didn't appeared for my screen reader, so i had to ask for some sight assistance, but with this help I was able to complete the task.
Mainly what I did was to use the same code for the 3 sounds, changeing some instructions like the file name or specifying if it was sound 1, 2 or 3.
