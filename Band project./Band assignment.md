#FOr this band project we used both html and css files.
The HTML was the code to create the site and the CSS file contained the vissuals like the fond.
Each mamber of the band wrote its own bio for the website, then we all came up with the band name.
althea Was in charge of creating the website using the code and we all contributed either writing the bios or searching for images to complement our bios.
I would evaluate this team work as good, since we all contributed to make the website of the way we wanted to look like, and the results where very satisfactory, so I think it was a good team work.
