FOr this assignment after reading the instructions, firstlly I used the example of how the first 5 numbers should look like in the console.
Then i used chat gpt to give me the list of all the nombers between 1 and 100 that where divisible between 3, 5 and 3 and 5 at the same time, to make the process more efitient and don't spend a long time counting.
After this, I wrote the list of numbers following the instructions and I checked my chat gpt list once I was done to make sure everything was correct.
